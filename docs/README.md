#### 2. Requirements
A requirements.txt file has been provided within this repository to outline the Python libraries required for the MCA tool.

#### 3. Structure of the code and directories
The main code is stored in streamlit_app.py. 

Data, images and other scripts referred to in this script are in the following sub-directories:
