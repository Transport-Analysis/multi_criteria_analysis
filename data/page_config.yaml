page_header: 'Smarter Solutions: Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) Tool'
page_intro: >
  This MCA tool has been designed for use in selecting a preferred option, or ranking alternate options, where Network 
  Optimisation Solutions (NOS) are included within assessment processes. The MCA Tool applies a standardised 
  consideration of NOS relative to large capital infrastructure, ensuring TMR is delivering the right 
  infrastructure at the right time and aligning with government policy direction for investment as outlined in 
  the Queensland Government's State Infrastructure Plan.

  To select from the predefined criteria simply use the provided select box, choosing the revelant Row ID of the criteria to be included.

  Custom user defined criteria can also be included using the provided text boxes. To include a custom criterion, ensure that both the criterion and category is included.

  An option has been included which allows the user to easily include all NOS Option's mandatory criteria within the analysis. 

  A list of selected criteria will be output at the bottom of the criteria section.

  Various criteria are mandatory when considering an NOS in the evaluation process. Additional criteria relating to 
  intersection delay, public transport patronage and freight should be selected where appropriate.
ranking_help: |
  This section allows the user to rank each criteria and input in a value for the relevant option and criterion.

  Each criterion is assigned a weight will will be used to calculate results. Weights will be automatically adjusted within the analysis to sum to 1.
  
  A slider bar will appear for each option and each criterion allowing the user to choose from a 1-5 scale.
